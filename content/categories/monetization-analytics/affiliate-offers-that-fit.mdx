## TL;DR

- Match offers to search and reader intent by mapping keywords, personas, and stage of awareness before you apply to programs.
- Assess partners on product-market fit, commission structure, compliance expectations, and support responsiveness before committing.
- Implement clear disclosures (`rel="sponsored"`) and consistent placement to protect trust and comply with FTC guidance.
- Track performance with UTMs, event goals, and RPM/EPMV dashboards so you can allocate traffic based on actual revenue per reader.

## Intent First: Align Offers With Audience Needs

Start by inventorying your top traffic sources and the problems readers expect you to solve. Group pages by funnel stage:

- **Problem aware:** Readers searching for symptoms (e.g., “why automation projects fail”).
- **Solution aware:** Readers comparing approaches (e.g., “automation workflow tools”).
- **Product aware:** Readers ready to buy (e.g., “best automation consultants pricing”).

For each cluster, list the jobs-to-be-done and the content format that best serves the intent. Map possible affiliate offers to each cluster. If you run editorial automation content, an AI automation consulting offer might fit top-of-funnel educational pieces, while n8n templates could fit how-to content such as ["n8n Triggers & Webhooks 101"](../n8n-workflows-integrations/n8n-triggers-webhooks-foundation.mdx).

### Scoring Matrix

Create a scoring model with weights for:

- **Audience fit (40%)** – Does the product solve the problem articulated in the content?
- **Trust signals (20%)** – Does the vendor provide transparent pricing, live support, and verified reviews?
- **Earning potential (20%)** – Evaluate commission rates, cookie duration, and upsell tiers.
- **Operational lift (10%)** – How hard is integration? Consider feed updates, creative approvals, and reporting cadence.
- **Compliance readiness (10%)** – Are program terms compatible with your disclosure standards and geo restrictions?

Score each candidate before applying. Document the rationale so stakeholders see you prioritized audience value.

## Criteria & Ethics Checklist

Before launching an offer, run through a due diligence checklist:

1. **Test the product:** Use a trial or demo. Document your hands-on experience to bolster credibility.
2. **Verify support:** Send a pre-sales question. Track response time and helpfulness.
3. **Review terms:** Note prohibited traffic sources, trademark bidding rules, and payout schedule.
4. **Check reviews:** Analyze third-party feedback to ensure the product delivers on promises.
5. **Confirm refund policies:** Understand how returns or cancellations impact commission reversals.
6. **Document your ethical stance:** Publish guidelines internally to prevent aggressive sales copy.

## Disclosure Playbook

Trust hinges on transparency. Follow these best practices:

- **Placement:** Add disclosures before affiliate links, not buried at the end. Use plain language: “We may earn a commission when you buy through our links.”
- **HTML attributes:** Mark affiliate URLs with `rel="sponsored"` and `rel="nofollow"` as required by search engines.
- **Consistency:** Use the same disclosure format across posts so repeat visitors know what to expect.
- **Localization:** Adjust language for regions with specific requirements (e.g., UK CMA guidelines).
- **Update cadence:** Revisit disclosures quarterly to ensure they reflect current partnerships.

If a piece of content is heavily monetized, collaborate with editorial stakeholders to balance calls to action with educational value. Refer to the briefing process in ["The Content Brief Generator"](../content-factory-distribution/content-brief-generator.mdx) to align monetization with storytelling.

## Attribution, UTMs, and Event Tracking

You can’t improve what you don’t measure. Establish a simple analytics stack:

1. **UTM standards:** Define parameters for `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, and `utm_content`. Share the naming convention with contributors.
2. **Link wrappers:** Use a link management tool to centralize affiliate URLs. This simplifies updates when programs change tracking codes.
3. **Event tracking:** Configure analytics goals or events for outbound affiliate clicks. In Google Analytics 4, mark them as conversions so they feed into attribution reports.
4. **Server-side tracking (optional):** For high-value programs, send conversions via server-side events to improve reliability.
5. **Reporting cadence:** Review performance weekly. Highlight top-performing pages and offers.

## Revenue Metrics: RPM and EPMV

Explain revenue metrics to stakeholders so they understand trade-offs:

- **RPM (Revenue per Mille):** Revenue per 1,000 pageviews for a single page or traffic source. Useful for comparing monetization efficiency across similar posts.
- **EPMV (Earnings per Mille Visitors):** Revenue per 1,000 sessions across the entire site. Helps evaluate overall monetization health and discover cannibalization.

Build dashboards that visualize RPM/EPMV over time alongside qualitative feedback. If RPM spikes but complaints increase, revisit offer alignment.

## Troubleshooting & Pitfalls

- **Offer creep:** Too many offers dilute trust. Cap the number of CTAs per page and rotate placements based on performance data.
- **Reporting gaps:** If partners provide delayed reports, supplement with click-tracking to anticipate trends.
- **Compliance slip-ups:** Maintain a disclosure audit log. Missing disclosures invite regulatory action.
- **Attribution disputes:** When multiple partners claim the same sale, document your tracking evidence and clarify terms before disputes arise.
