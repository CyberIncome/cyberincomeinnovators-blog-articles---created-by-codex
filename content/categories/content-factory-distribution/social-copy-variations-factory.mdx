TL;DR
- Start with a core story, then generate channel-specific briefs capturing audience, tone, and CTA for each platform.
- Use AI prompts and templates to spin controlled variations, then test headlines, hooks, and creative pairings.
- Govern outputs with style guides, compliance checks, and performance dashboards to scale without losing brand equity.

## Core Story Intake
Identify the flagship asset—article, webinar, product launch—and document key messages, proof points, and target personas. Define campaign goals (awareness, engagement, conversion) and map to channel objectives. Store the story in a shared workspace accessible to writers and automation workflows.

### Channel Briefs
Create mini-briefs for each channel (LinkedIn, X, Instagram, TikTok). Capture audience insights, preferred tone, character limits, and formatting rules (hashtags, emojis). Reference the AI editorial style guide to align voice. Use the content brief generator to automate these briefs when possible.

## AI-Assisted Variation Generation
Craft prompt templates for each channel that specify tone, CTA, and structural elements (hook, insight, CTA). Generate multiple variations and categorize them by angle (statistic-led, narrative, objection handling). Use automation to push drafts into collaboration tools for review.

### Testing Framework
Deploy variations via controlled experiments. On platforms supporting A/B testing, rotate copy while holding creative constant. Track metrics—click-through rate, engagement, saves—per variation. Feed results into an offer testing framework or analytics dashboard.

## Governance and QA
Run automated checks for banned phrases, compliance requirements, and link accuracy. Ensure affiliate disclosures appear where required. Use the CI pipeline to lint copy for tone and readability. Provide human review for high-stakes campaigns.

### Distribution Rhythm
Schedule publishing cadences per channel, considering time zones and algorithm preferences. Build a content calendar that reuses top-performing variations, adjusting CTA or hooks for subsequent waves. Document learnings in retrospectives.

## Comparison Table
| Channel | Core Goal | Key Constraints | Tone | Measurement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LinkedIn | Thought leadership | 3000 char limit | Professional + personable | CTR, comments |
| X (Twitter) | Real-time engagement | 280 char limit | Punchy, concise | Engagement rate |
| Instagram | Visual storytelling | Caption + hashtags | Conversational | Saves, shares |
| TikTok | Short-form video | Script <60s | Energetic | Watch time, follows |
